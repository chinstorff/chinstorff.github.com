# Early Western Music Research

In my final semester at [Tufts University][tufts-university], I had the privilege to conduct primary historical research of a medieval musical text. The university library maintains a collection of ancient books including the _Breviary for the Night Office_, a medieval catholic liturgical book containing chants and some early sheet music. Reading through this brief selection of music and attempting to parse and translate the accompanying chant comprised the bulk of my research. This page contains a summary of my findings.

## The Breviary
No exact date or location of origin is known for this _Breviary for the Night Office_. The script and form of music notation as I describe in more detail below suggest it is of late twelfth to early thirteenth century western German origin.

The Divine Office, or Liturgy of the Hours, is the set of prayers that mark each time during the day performed by officials of the Catholic Church. It consists of psalms and hymns, as well as readings and antiphons. Together with the weekly Mass, it contains all of the prayers for standard Catholic practice. The liturgical books that contain all the texts and music for the Divine Office are called the breviary. In addition to psalms and hymns, the breviary contains chants sung before and after a psalm called antiphons. The breviary was a common book form across catholic Europe.

The Night Office is the part of the Divine Office that occurs at night, with specific prayers and texts called matins that are recited at 9pm, midnight, or 3am. This book contains prayers and hymns for the Night Office.

The paste-downs on the inside cover of the book contain chants from the same Antiphonary, with the front paste-down containing chants for Matins for Thursday and Friday of Ordinary Time and the back pasted-won containing chants for Matins for Septuagesima. These chants are set to music notated in Hufnagel neumes, a form of specifically German musical notation. The relatively unshaded character and the transitional Protogothic/Gothic character of the script point to a dating in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century for this book.

Hufnagel neumes, also called Gothic neumes, are a style of notation visible in late medieval manuscripts from Germany. There are named this way because of the way the standard neume figure resembles the shape of a horseshoe nail. Hufnagel neumes were used as late as the eighteenth century.

With an understanding of Hufnagel neumes and a parsing of the Latin text, it is possible to compare this piece to others in different breviaries and antiphonaries. The front pastedown contains a collection of psalms and the back pastedown contains the story of Adam and Eve.

## The front pastedown

The front pastedown contains an assortment of psalm excerpts from the [Vulgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate), a 4th century Latin translation of The Bible which later became the standard across Europe. The psalm excerpts share common themes of brief praises and exultations of God. The text in the pastedowns is very close to an exact match of psalms in the Vulgate [as digitized and circulated by Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalmi+1&version=VULGATE). Unlike the book of Genesis, the original textual source for the [back pastedown][back-pastedown], the book of Psalms has considerable variance of location and inclusion of chapters and verses across versions. The English translations are therefore approximate and were made with the assistance of [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/).

Note that '[Euouae](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/euouae)' is a Latin abbreviation representing a specific melodic cadence from the Gloria Patri doxology. It translates to "unto the ages of ages" and is not considered part of the individual psalm fragments.

## The back pastedown
This text from the back pastedown tells the story of Genesis 2:20-23 and Genesis 3:8. It is unclear from which edition of the Bible this text is sourced. It is in Latin, but does not match corresponding verses in the [Vulgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate), a 4th century Latin translation of The Bible which later became the standard across Europe. Currently circulated digitized resources find this exact text only as chants in other breviaries and antiphonaries.

## Additional thoughts

While each individual chant can be found in other sources, there does not appear to be another book with all of the same chants. Most of the chants found in this breviary can be found with limited changes to the text in the mid-sixteenth century [Salzinnes Antiphonal](https://smu.ca/academics/archives/the-salzinnes-antiphonal.html), made by nuns in an abbey outside of Namur (modern day Belgium). This fits in line geographically with the Hufnagel neumes, which suggests that these two books were closely related and of the same or similar traditions. The Salzinnes Antiphonal is now located at St. Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada and [has been digitized](https://cantus.simssa.ca/manuscript/133).

Further research can be done into a finer-toothed comparison of the neumes to which the text is set. So far, the comparisons of this _Breviary for the Night Office_ and other sources including the _Salzinnes Antiphonal_ is primarily based on the text and not on the neumes themselves. The psalms can potentially be matched up with more standardized and translatable versions of The Bible and potentially a stronger pattern between them can emerge. Additionally, only around half of the back pastedown was translated and analyzed here. The other half likely contains earlier parts of Genesis 2, but may contain something else entirely.
