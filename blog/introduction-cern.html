		<p><span class="caps">CERN</span> is a nice place to work, I will explain how is it from the perspective of an <span class="caps">IT</span>&nbsp;intern.</p>
<h2>How is a normal working&nbsp;day?</h2>
<p>The teams I joined were flexible with the time, just be responsible and on time for the meetings, usually people come from 7-9 and leave at 16-18:30.  You will need an access card to enter the installations. Most teams start the morning enjoying a coffee&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>Lunch time is from 12-14, if you want you can have dinner at restaurant&nbsp;1.</p>
<p>There are several meeting per week, some of them on the phone to coordinate with people from other countries. It depends on your project. From time to time there are interesting talks about distributed computing,&nbsp;security&#8230;.</p>
<p>The friday afternoon some teams go for a beer together&nbsp;:)</p>
<h2>What kind of projects I will be working&nbsp;on?</h2>
<p>Well, <span class="caps">CERN</span> is big, so they are looking for a lot of different profiles. Some skills on <span class="caps">IT</span>&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Distributed and grid&nbsp;computing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Databases, specially&nbsp;Oracle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual&nbsp;machines</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What kind of contract they&nbsp;offer?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Openlab Student: only for <span class="caps">IT</span>, you spend 2 months working on a project. At the time I was in they pay 5000 <span class="caps">CHF</span> for the whole summer. This summer I was living in a <a href="http://gmaps.com">nuclear bunker</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summer student: 2 or 3 months, with 2500 <span class="caps">CHF</span> per month to live. During the mornings you will assist to some interesting lectures and during the afternoon you have to work on a project. The deadline to apply is in&nbsp;January.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical student: for students of the member states. The contract is from 6 months to 14 months and they pay you around 3300 <span class="caps">CHF</span> per&nbsp;month. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fellowship: for recent graduates or people with less than 4 years of experience. One year of contract with the opportunity to renew one year more. The salary is around 5000&nbsp;<span class="caps">CHF</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staff: this contract is really difficult to get. You have to spend one day with a comitee but the contract is for 3-5 years. I don&#8217;t know the salary but it&#8217;s a well paid&nbsp;job.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more types of contracts, check out <a href="http://cern.ch/jobs"><span class="caps">CERN</span> jobs page</a> or follow the <a href="http://twitter.com/cern_jobs">twitter account</a>.</p>
<h2>How about the&nbsp;accomodation?</h2>
<p>This is hard, really hard. There are a lot of people looking for flats in Geneva, so it is difficult to find a good or cheap&nbsp;appartment. </p>
<p><span class="caps">CERN</span> is <a href="http://gmaps.com">located in the border with France</a>, so  basically you have two&nbsp;options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Live in France: <a href="http://gmaps.com">Saint Genis</a>, Sergy, Thoiry. I&#8217;ve been living in Saint Genis, in a house about 10-20 mins walking to <span class="caps">CERN</span>. The place is agradable but it&#8217;s better if you have a car to move around. It&#8217;s difficult to find a place but not as difficult as in&nbsp;Geneva.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Live in Geneva: expect to pay a lot for a small appartment. It helps if you speak a little bit of French. Since April 2011 <span class="caps">CERN</span> is connected to the center of Geneva by&nbsp;tram. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>It&#8217;s expensive to live in&nbsp;Switzerland?</h2>
<p>Of course it is! But with the salary they pay you will be enough to live (if you are a little bit careful). Expect to pay at least 1000 <span class="caps">CHF</span> to live in Geneva and 500 Euros for a shared house in France. Public transport is expensive too 3 <span class="caps">CHF</span> per ticket, a ticket lasts for one hour.
Supermarket is a little bit expensive too, check out the prices of <a href="http://www.migros.ch/fr/m-go-info/m-go-version-web.html">Migros</a>.</p>
<p>For lunch you can eat at <span class="caps">CERN</span> in one of the three canteems, the basic menu is 8 <span class="caps">CHF</span> and the special one 12. Food is good and <a href="https://resto2.web.cern.ch">varied</a> they have a vegetarian option. If you want to bring your own food there are microvawes on the&nbsp;restaurants.</p>
<h2>Free&nbsp;time</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of activities for summer students and a lot of team barbeques during the&nbsp;summer.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CERN</span> have <a href="http://user.web.cern.ch/user/Communication/SocialLifeActivities/Clubs/Clubs.html">a lot of clubs</a>, some of them are free for some you have to pay a small&nbsp;quote. </p>
<p>Unfortunately night life in Geneva it&#8217;s not very&nbsp;exciting&#8230;</p>
<h2>Useful&nbsp;sites</h2>
<p>There are a lot of websites at <span class="caps">CERN</span> (did I mention it&#8217;s the place where the web was born?), but here are the ones I found more&nbsp;useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>
