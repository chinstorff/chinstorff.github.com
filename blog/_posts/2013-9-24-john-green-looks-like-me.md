title: John Green looks like me
---

John Green is a New York Times [bestselling author](http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2013-09-29/young-adult/list.html).

John Green is a [Youtuber](http://youtube.com/vlogbrothers) with hundreds of millions of views.

John Green looks like [me](http://chinstorff.com). Or, as I'm younger, I look like John Green. Either way, we look similar.

About a week ago, my recently posted Facebook profile picture brought about confusion as to why I was posting a picture of John Green. I decided then that I should email him.

It wasn't easy to find his email address. His website's [contact info](http://johngreenbooks.com/bio-contact/the-contact-page/) page gave me the email addresses of his staff, but not his own. I then googled "John Green email address". After searching through a few links, I finally found his email address and began to write my message.

*Hi Mr. Green,*

*I am a high school student from Palo Alto, California.*

*It has recently come to my attention that I look like you. I recently posted a picture of me as a profile picture on facebook and I got asked why I changed it to a picture of John Green.*

*I don't know why I'm telling you this. Maybe it's so you won't be surprised if you ever see yourself walking down the street. Maybe it's so if I ever become a NY times best selling author, you can say that you look like me.*

*Our pictures are below. I have done you the favor of labeling who each of us are as it otherwise may have been difficult to discern.*

*Best wishes,*

*Christopher Hinstorff*

I thought that this was a pretty good letter (I didn't notice my subject-verb agreement error until later), so I sent the message and promptly went to bed and forgot about it.

A week later, I got a wonderful surprise. In my email inbox lay a reply from none other than John Green.

At first, I was a bit confused. Why would John Green be sending me an email? Oh wait, he's replied to my email from last week. Oh my god, he replied to my email from last week!

His response was short and sweet; a man as busy as John Green does not have time for a long, drawn out reply.

*Clearly, Christopher, we are secret siblings.*

*Thanks for sharing!*

*John*

I choose to believe that his message was written by him rather than a member of his staff. I choose to believe that he responds to each of the many emails sent to him one by one, which is why it took him so long to get to mine. I could be wrong, but that doesn't matter to me.

No matter what, I will always have my secret sibling, John Green.
