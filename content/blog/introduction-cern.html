CERN is a nice place to work, I will explain how is it from the perspective of an IT intern. 

{%- endmark %}

## How is a normal working day? ##

The teams I joined were flexible with the time, just be responsible and on time for the meetings, usually people come from 7-9 and leave at 16-18:30.  You will need an access card to enter the installations. Most teams start the morning enjoying a coffee together.

Lunch time is from 12-14, if you want you can have dinner at restaurant 1.

There are several meeting per week, some of them on the phone to coordinate with people from other countries. It depends on your project. From time to time there are interesting talks about distributed computing, security....

The friday afternoon some teams go for a beer together :)

## What kind of projects I will be working on? ##

Well, CERN is big, so they are looking for a lot of different profiles. Some skills on IT are:

 - Distributed and grid computing

 - Databases, specially Oracle

 - Monitoring

 - Virtual machines

## What kind of contract they offer? ##

 - Openlab Student: only for IT, you spend 2 months working on a project. At the time I was in they pay 5000 CHF for the whole summer. This summer I was living in a [nuclear bunker][LAGOLLETTE].

 - Summer student: 2 or 3 months, with 2500 CHF per month to live. During the mornings you will assist to some interesting lectures and during the afternoon you have to work on a project. The deadline to apply is in January.

 - Technical student: for students of the member states. The contract is from 6 months to 14 months and they pay you around 3300 CHF per month. 

 - Fellowship: for recent graduates or people with less than 4 years of experience. One year of contract with the opportunity to renew one year more. The salary is around 5000 CHF.

 - Staff: this contract is really difficult to get. You have to spend one day with a comitee but the contract is for 3-5 years. I don't know the salary but it's a well paid job.

There are more types of contracts, check out [CERN jobs page][CERNJOBS] or follow the [twitter account][CERNJOBSTWITTER].

## How about the accomodation? ##

This is hard, really hard. There are a lot of people looking for flats in Geneva, so it is difficult to find a good or cheap appartment. 

CERN is [located in the border with France][LAGOLLETTE], so  basically you have two options:

- Live in France: [Saint Genis][SAINTGENIS], Sergy, Thoiry. I've been living in Saint Genis, in a house about 10-20 mins walking to CERN. The place is agradable but it's better if you have a car to move around. It's difficult to find a place but not as difficult as in Geneva.

- Live in Geneva: expect to pay a lot for a small appartment. It helps if you speak a little bit of French. Since April 2011 CERN is connected to the center of Geneva by tram. 

## It's expensive to live in Switzerland? ##

Of course it is! But with the salary they pay you will be enough to live (if you are a little bit careful). Expect to pay at least 1000 CHF to live in Geneva and 500 Euros for a shared house in France. Public transport is expensive too 3 CHF per ticket, a ticket lasts for one hour.
Supermarket is a little bit expensive too, check out the prices of [Migros][MIGROS].

For lunch you can eat at CERN in one of the three canteems, the basic menu is 8 CHF and the special one 12. Food is good and [varied][RESTO2] they have a vegetarian option. If you want to bring your own food there are microvawes on the restaurants.

## Free time ##

There's a lot of activities for summer students and a lot of team barbeques during the summer.

CERN have [a lot of clubs][CLUBS], some of them are free for some you have to pay a small quote. 

Unfortunately night life in Geneva it's not very exciting...

## Useful sites ##

There are a lot of websites at CERN (did I mention it's the place where the web was born?), but here are the ones I found more useful:

 - If you have to go to building XYZ for a meeting, find it on [CERN maps][CERNMAPS]

 - Many administrative task can be done using [EDH][EDH]

  - [CERN phonebook][PHONEBOOK]

 - [CERN document server][CDS] created by the incredible guys developing [Invenio][INVENIO]. You can find articles, videos and even order a book from the library that will be sent to your office.

 - [Indico][INDICO] to manage conferences and meetings. It's possible to reserve rooms like the BBQ place from Indico.

 - [Restaurant 1][RESTO1] and [restaurant 2 menu][RESTO2]

 - [CERN market][MARKET], where you can find an appartment or buy and sell second hand stuff.

 - [Guided tours and visits][VISITS]
