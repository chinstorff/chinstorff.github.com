Most people watch theatrical performances from the audience.

While I am typing this, I am watching [Paly Theatre](http://palytheatre.com)'s production of [Aladdin](/static/images/aladdin.jpg). Well, I'm not really watching it. I'm listening to the performance.

I can hear the music and the sound effects clearly; I can hear the actors who are loud enough to project through the house. Sometimes I hear all the diologue, sometimes just half, and sometimes there's nothing at all.

I can't see the stage at all. When the actors exit the back of the house, I see them pass by. Sometimes they walk, sometimes they run, and sometimes they take their sweet time.

It's not the normal way to attend the show. It's not the way shows should be experienced, but who cares about "should be" anyway.
