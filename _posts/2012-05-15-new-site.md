I had this site a little bit abandoned, so I decided to rewrite it one more time. This time I opted for a simpler design but the biggest change is that I decided to abandon [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and create a static site. 

Static sites can be hosted it on github pages, so I can save some MBs in the hosting. It's easy to publish new content, just make a commit to the forge. Moreover, this site doesn't need 90% of the functionality offered by Django, I was using a sledgehammer to crack nuts.

But of course I didn't create the HTML files from scratch, I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

### Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator developed in Ruby. It has support for markdown and integration with github pages. With the help of [Jekyll bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) I was able to create the new version in a couple of hours.

Jekyll is really simple, just run `jekyll --serve` in your project folder and it will parse the markdown and create the site. The generated site will be in the `_site` folder. Serve this folder with your static HTTP server (Nginx, Apache...) and enjoy.

[Hyde](https://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde) is a similar project in Python, and it was my first option. I installed the new version but the documentation is really poor(at the time of writing). I decided to install the old version but I found [this bug](https://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde/issues/54). I realize I was spending too much time for such a simple task. Time to abandon Hyde and embrace Jekyll.

### Design

I'm not a designer but fortunately I had Twitter bootstrap and Google fonts to help me to create a readable design. I want to create long articles, so readability it's an important point. I tried many fonts until one day I discovered [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com/) site, I shamelessly copied his font selection.

### Show me the code
