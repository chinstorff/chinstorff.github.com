The Paly Voice is headed off to San Francisco, where we'll be attending several events, including the [Online News Association](http://ona12.journalists.org/) conference. Many prominent journalists will be speaking there.

I'm also attending a drone journalism mini-conference, since Voice decided to buy a quad-rotor video drone. I'll put up footage when I can.

The event schedule is available [here](http://ona2012.sched.org/).
