title: Domino Rube Goldberg machine
---

[Domino shows](http://youtu.be/D08q5hMNKcQ) are the famous displays of dominoes, where dominoes fall in sequence. Domino shows are common and aren't noteworthy.

Rube Goldberg machines are overcomplicated contraptions designed to accomplish simple tasks. They're cool to watch and tend to exhibit interesting chain reactions.

A couple of friends and I decided to combine these two inventions to create a Rube Goldberg machine out of dominoes. We created three out of the six possible [simple machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_machine) using dominoes, hot glue, and paper.
