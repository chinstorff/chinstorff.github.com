Today's my birthday, but I decided to have my party yesterday. It was a small get-together of six people, which dropped down to three who slept over.

Before we went to bed, though, we decided to hang out and talk in the hot tub. That was fine and dandy, and we all had a great time. We got out at midnight, dried off, got changed in the pool house, and walked back toward the house.

Unfortunately for us, my parents had unwittingly locked us out of the house. We tried every door around the house before going to look for a house key. We checked the pool house, the garage, and under our nonexistent door mats. No dice.

We thought about our options:
	
    * Sleep outside, using whatever towels in the pool house as blankets
    * Ring the doorbell
    * Climb up the side of the house to my room's open window, pop the screen out, and let people in

Nobody liked the first option, and the second option would have woken my siblings up. We chose the third option.

I put a small table on top of a bench, and then a chair on top of the table. My friends Leah, Sophia, and Nick all held them to make sure I didn't fall over. I climbed up, pulled myself onto the roof, and crawled over toward my room. Lucky for me, the laundry room window was also open, so I worked on popping out the little pins on the inside that held the screen in place.

Five minutes and several bent fingernails later, all the pins were out, and I started to push the screen out. No dice; it was fixed at the bottom, presumably to prevent bugs from coming in. I have no idea why there are pins if the entire bottom is attached to the window frame.

I whispered down to Leah, Sophia, and Nick, relaying my discovery. We all agreed that I should go over to my parents' room and softly knock until they opened our balcony door to let me in. I did so, and the conversation with my sleepy mother went something like this:

Mom: (rubbing her eyes sleepily) What... how did you get up here?
Me: Don't worry about it. Can I go and let everyone else in?
Mom: (still rubbing her eyes) Sure... but what time is it?
Me: Eh, roughly midnight. Not sure exactly. I don't have a watch on and everybody's phones are inside. I'm going to go downstairs and let people in now. Thanks!
Mom: ...alright, I'm going back to bed.

She yawned, and walked back into her room. Everybody was relieved that we didn't have to spend the night outside, and everything went better than expected.
