Jensen, a friend of mine, asked me a few days ago if I could install Linux on his Chromebook. His reason? He wanted to play Minecraft. Perfectly legit, I suppose.





It seems that not many people do this, and are happy with ChromeOS, so there wasn't too much help online; however, I found this [one great article](http://www.devchronicles.com/2011/10/installing-ubuntu-on-samsung-series-5.html).





To those unable to boot into Ubuntu for some reason, or want to switch between them... this is how!





EDIT: Samsung's Series-5 Chromebook isn't powerful enough to play Minecraft. Oh well :(
