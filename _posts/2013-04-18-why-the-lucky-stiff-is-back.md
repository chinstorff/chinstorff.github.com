If you haven't heard all the hubbub in the Ruby community, it appears as though prominent programmer why the lucky stiff is back. Several years ago, he disappeared completely, taking almost all traces on the internet with him. 102 days ago, in January, he updated his [site](http://whytheluckystiff.net) for the first time since he disappeared.

It was a cryptic message:

`Public Print Queue SPOOL/DESOLEE 2012-01-06T08:21Z`

Some smart people figured out that it was an HP PCL file, and converted it into a PDF.

Recently, \_why has been uploading more and more of these files... and so I present to you a complete and live-updating collection of these files! Take a look [here](http://why.apps.hypeno.de).
