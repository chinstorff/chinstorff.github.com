Sometimes, just to screw with people, I will rewrite `.bashrc` to contain only:


    
    echo "Python 2.6.6 (r266:84374, Aug 31 2010, 11:00:51)
    [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493)] on darwin
    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information."
    export PS1=">>> "
    trap bashtrap INT
    bashtrap() {
        echo -n "
    KeyboardInterrupt"
    }



and watch people struggle :)
