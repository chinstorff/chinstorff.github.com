    <p>As of June 2012, the end of the school year last year, I was effective webmaster of the Paly Voice, my high school&#8217;s strictly online publication. In order to try and cover hosting/domain costs, I put up one Google AdSense ad on the sidebar of stories.</p>

<p>If you turn off your ad blocker, you can see it in action <a href='http://palyvoice.com/2012/09/02/students-give-back-through-amigos-program/'>here</a>.</p>

<p>In the first few days we had the ad, I was excited to even make pennies. After a few days, however, I realized that pennies wouldn&#8217;t cover our monthly and annual expenses. My first thought was to sell ad spots to local businesses for around $500 a week. That sounds like a lot, but consider the followning:</p>

<p>* Campanile (another Paly publication, except strictly print) sells roughly the same size ads for $200.</p>

<p>* Campanile circulates for roughly 4 days.</p>

<p>* Campanile has an audience of about 1000 people, total.</p>

<p>Assuming we&#8217;re going to scale the price up in a linear fashion, and reach the same number of people, we can charge $350 for a 24/7 ad spot. We don&#8217;t, however, have the same reach. Voice gets about 1000 unique visitors per day, and about 15000 total views per month. We could easily charge over $500, but we wanted a nice, round number.</p>

<p>This plan still isn&#8217;t particularly lucrative. We could make $4000 a month if we replaced the AdSense with local ads, and probably will. To put it bluntly: compared to the other publications, we&#8217;d be rolling around in money.</p>

<p>AdSense got me thinking, though. Sometimes we made $10 from only 4 clicks. What if there was some way of guaranteeing a large amount of clicks per day? Turns out there is. It&#8217;s called a <strong>botnet</strong>.</p>

<p>To quote Cory Doctorow&#8217;s <em>Little Brother</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Botnets are where infected computers spend their afterlives. When you get a worm or a virus, your computer sends a message to a chat channel on IRC &#8211; the Internet Relay Chat. That message tells the botmaster &#8211; the guy who deployed the worm &#8211; that the computers are there ready to do his bidding. Botnets are supremely powerful, since they can comprise thousands, even hundreds of thousands of computers, scattered all over the Internet, connected to juicy high-speed connections and running on fast home PCs. Those PCs normally function on behalf of their owners, but when the botmaster calls them, they rise like zombies to do his bidding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With so many infected computers on the market, the price of renting some time on one has dropped dramatically. When I checked last night, the price of renting one for 24 hours had <a href='http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/study-finds-the-average-price-for-renting-a-botnet/6528'>plummeted to $67</a>&#8230; and that was in 2010. It&#8217;s probably dropped further. If you consider what you could accomplish with a couple thousand high-powered computers in 24 hours, that&#8217;s next to nothing.</p>

<p>With 33 legitimate clicks, Voice made $20. If each computer in a botnet only clicks once on an ad, you can easily eclipse your operating costs. To keep Google in the dark, however, you have to spread out your clicks pretty evenly. Some computers have to click, but others can only view. Assuming the average ad clicker clicks about 3 ads, you&#8217;re making a serious amount of money each day.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t, of course, legal&#8230; but when has that ever stopped anybody? Voice will use legitimate sources of revenue, however. Make no mistake.</p>
