    <p>Today&#8217;s my birthday, but I decided to have my party yesterday. It was a small get-together of six people, which dropped down to three who slept over.</p>

<p>Before we went to bed, though, we decided to hang out and talk in the hot tub. That was fine and dandy, and we all had a great time. We got out at midnight, dried off, got changed in the pool house, and walked back toward the house.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for us, my parents had unwittingly locked us out of the house. We tried every door around the house before going to look for a house key. We checked the pool house, the garage, and under our nonexistent door mats. No dice.</p>

<p>We thought about our options:</p>

<p>* Sleep outside, using whatever towels in the pool house as blankets</p>

<p>* Ring the doorbell</p>

<p>* Climb up the side of the house to my room&#8217;s open window, pop the screen out, and let people in</p>

<p>Nobody liked the first option, and the second option would have woken my siblings up. We chose the third option.</p>

<p>I put a small table on top of a bench, and then a chair on top of the table. My friends Leah, Sophia, and Nick all held them to make sure I didn&#8217;t fall over. I climbed up, pulled myself onto the roof, and crawled over toward my room. Lucky for me, the laundry room window was also open, so I worked on popping out the little pins on the inside that held the screen in place.</p>

<p>Five minutes and several bent fingernails later, all the pins were out, and I started to push the screen out. No dice; it was fixed at the bottom, presumably to prevent bugs from coming in. I have no idea why there are pins if the entire bottom is attached to the window frame.</p>

<p>I whispered down to Leah, Sophia, and Nick, relaying my discovery. We all agreed that I should go over to my parents&#8217; room and softly knock until they opened our balcony door to let me in. I did so, and the conversation with my sleepy mother went something like this:</p>

<p>Mom: (rubbing her eyes sleepily) What&#8230; how did you get up here? Me: Don&#8217;t worry about it. Can I go and let everyone else in? Mom: (still rubbing her eyes) Sure&#8230; but what time is it? Me: Eh, roughly midnight. Not sure exactly. I don&#8217;t have a watch on and everybody&#8217;s phones are inside. I&#8217;m going to go downstairs and let people in now. Thanks! Mom: &#8230;alright, I&#8217;m going back to bed.</p>

<p>She yawned, and walked back into her room. Everybody was relieved that we didn&#8217;t have to spend the night outside, and everything went better than expected.</p>
