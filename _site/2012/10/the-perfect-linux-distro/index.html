    <p>I recently found the subreddit <a href='http://reddit.com/r/distrohopping'>/r/DistroHopping</a>, and was subsequently made a moderator. This brought me back to the days (well, six months ago) when I would hop almost daily between distributions, trying to find one that works for me.</p>

<p>I never actually found the &#8220;perfect distro&#8221; that I needed, but hopefully from my analysis here I can help myself and others.</p>

<p>I started to use Ubuntu back in the days when Ubuntu 6 was hot stuff:<a href='/static/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screenshot.png'><img alt='' src='/static/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screenshot.png' /></a></p>

<p>This was my first exposure to Linux, coming from Mac OS and Windows XP/ME. It was 2008 or so, and I was vacationing in California with my family (we used to live in California, moved to Connecticut, kept the house, and eventually moved back). Our neighbors had a tutor over who was teaching programming. I decided to jump in on the class. He required that we work in a Linux environment, so I installed the latest Ubuntu in a VM.</p>

<p>It was awesome; the menus were all logical and easily accessible, and for some strange reason, the UI looked amazing to me, and still does. I suppose I prefer GNOME2 to GNOME3 universally.</p>

<p>I migrated to the command line almost exclusively, and became a huge fan of aptitude. Its interface was simple, and all I really did was install and remove packages.</p>

<p>Either way, a pretty (but functional) UI is a big thing for me. I don&#8217;t want to be working, staring at an eyesore. So let&#8217;s keep that in mind&#8230; there should be a relatively simple UI, but things should be within reach, and preferably keyboard accessible.</p>

<p>After some time with Ubuntu, I got sick of looking at it, and moved to Fedora. Fedora was coming out with version 11 at the time, I think:<a href='/static/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fedora_screenshot.png'><img alt='' src='/static/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fedora_screenshot.png' /></a></p>

<p>The blue color scheme was refreshing&#8230; at the time I did not know about skins and theming. The switch to Fedora was for no reason exciting except for the novelty of a new OS. I learned to use yum with ease, and then the fun was over. It became in essence the same as Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Of course! They both used GNOME2. I switched to KDE, but found my hardware couldn&#8217;t handle it. Regardless, I didn&#8217;t much like my OS looking &#8220;pretty&#8221; like that, especially if I wanted to take myself seriously.</p>

<p>A problem arose: neither of these OSes is programmer-centric. Everybody thinks, &#8220;Oh, just use some distribution of Linux! They&#8217;re all for programmers.&#8221; But they&#8217;re really not. Linux is great for development, but there is no OS (that I&#8217;ve found) that is perfectly programmer-centric: console always at the ready, system monitoring in the background, minimalist UI, and a hacker &#8220;feel.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stopped using Linux for a few years, just programming in whatever Unix-based environment Mac OS X has. I moved to Palo Alto from Greenwich, Connecticut. Joined the robotics team. Became a lot more involved in anything and everything technical. Acquired a six year old HP Compaq, and installed Linux Mint. <a href='/static/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Linux-Mint-13-RC-Cinnamon-Screenshot-Tour-20.jpg'><img alt='' src='/static/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Linux-Mint-13-RC-Cinnamon-Screenshot-Tour-20-1024x576.jpg' /></a></p>

<p>For our onboard robotics laptop that was going to be used for image processing, we installed Trisquel. <a href='/static/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/linux-screenshot-trisquel-5-5-03.jpg'><img alt='' src='/static/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/linux-screenshot-trisquel-5-5-03.jpg' /></a></p>

<p>I was happier with Mint than with Trisquel; Trisquel wasn&#8217;t as familiar, was a tad too &#8220;beautiful&#8221; for my taste, and didn&#8217;t feel like a solid distro. I don&#8217;t really know what I mean by solid, but it didn&#8217;t feel serious enough for me. It&#8217;s the reason I can&#8217;t do development on Mac OS X. Mint felt like a prettier Ubuntu with GNOME2.</p>

<p>I guess the OS really doesn&#8217;t matter; one can fairly easily adapt to the different package managers, figure out where some configurations are stored, or find binaries that will work for you. Even then, I could find an apt port for Fedora.</p>

<p>What matters, as far as looks, is the DM/WM combo. Everything else is pretty consistent.</p>

<p>Put concisely, a programmer&#8217;s ideal environment would be as such (in no particular order):</p>

<p>* Terminal always at the ready</p>

<p>* Minimalist UI. Not overly pretty, but not as spartan as, say, Fluxbox or TWM.</p>

<p>* Completely configurable UI, but configuration should be optional for the love of all that is holy. This is the reason I&#8217;m not particularly fond of installing Arch.</p>

<p>* Emacs/Vim as an IDE â€” built-in compile and testing tools, as well as some basic functionality to compute runtime complexity of some functions.</p>

<p>* Fast boot and log-in times.</p>

<p>Right now, my laptop has a good amount of those. Crunchbang was great for the stats - there was some awesome Openbox config.</p>

<p>And that brings me to a failed project of mine and Sidhanth&#8217;s - eos. Eos was a debian-based OS targeted at programmers with all of the aforementioned features&#8230; but development stalled as our school loads increased, and we never got to finish. We&#8217;ll probably upload what we have to GitHub sometime.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m running the latest Fedora with Cinnamon.</p>

<p>Good luck in your search.</p>
