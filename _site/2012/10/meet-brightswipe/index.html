    <p>Since I posted in July about the private torrent indexer, I&#8217;ve been working on something called Brightswipe. <a href='http://brightswipe.com'>Brightswipe</a> is a beautiful, fast, and open-source indexer written in Ruby/Sinatra.</p>

<p>I chose Sinatra because I wanted to learn Ruby, and thought Rails was too clunky for this small of a project.</p>

<p>Originally, the entirety of Brightswipe was in one 200-line Ruby file with no styling at all. As the project progressed, however, I decided instead to segment it, putting the views in their own <code>views/</code> folder.</p>

<p>Still, though, <code>indexer.rb</code> was too long and complex, so I moved the <code>configure</code> block and functions out into their separate files.</p>

<p>I tried to add a second database option â€” MongoDB. Mongo, unfortunately, its not suited for the structure I chose for the DB. Halfway through adding in all the code, I decided that it was not worth it at all.</p>

<p>I then ditched both and decided to use DataMapper with MySQL.</p>

<p>One day, I was reading through Hacker News, and a guy by the name of Michael Mettler (<a href='http://card.io'>card.io</a> co-founder) was freely offering 10 domain names that he no longer needed. Among the list, I spotted a domain that I liked: <code>brightswipe.com</code>.</p>

<p>I wrote a comment on the post, explaining how I already had written an application and just needed a designer, and gave him my email address. Within a few hours, he&#8217;d emailed me to tell me that I&#8217;d gotten the domain, and just to start the transfer process.</p>

<p>I happily complied. Within another few hours, I got an email from a guy named <a href='http://madebyargon.com'>Ashraful</a>. He said that he&#8217;d seen my comment, and was willing to design for me. I told him that I had a $0 budget, but would happy to code for design.</p>

<p>He agreed, and within a week I had a running design for Brightswipe: <a href='/static/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/brightswipe-home.jpg'><img alt='' src='/static/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/brightswipe-home-1024x619.jpg' /></a></p>

<p>It turned out that Ashraful wasn&#8217;t so great with CSS, so all I had was a PSD and an image render. I&#8217;m not great with CSS either, unfortunately.</p>

<p>I decided to contact another designer named <a href='http://egegorgulu.com'>Ege</a>. I explained my predicament, and my lack of budget. I told him that he&#8217;d get his name in the footer of the site (along with mine) when it went live. He agreed to help out with translating to CSS.</p>

<p>The site goes live today. I&#8217;m posting about it on Hacker News and Reddit, too. Please, comment with your feedback!</p>

<p>P.S. The <a href='http://github.com/tekknolagi/indexer'>code</a> is on GitHub!</p>
