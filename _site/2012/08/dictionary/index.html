    <p>There&#8217;s this game my family plays, either alone or with other families, and it&#8217;s called dictionary. I&#8217;m not convinced that my dad didn&#8217;t just make that name up.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong> The players (four or more) find a dictionary, slips of paper, and enough pens so that each person has one. The starting person flips through the dictionary until he finds a word that he likes, and makes sure that nobody in the group knows what the word means. The other players copy this down.</p>

<p>The players without the dictionary try and make up the most convincing definition for the word, while the first player writes down the actual definition.</p>

<p>Everybody folds the slips of paper, and hands them to the player with the dictionary, who then proceeds to read all of them (including the real definition) aloud.</p>

<p>The non-dictionary players vote on what seems to be the realest-sounding definition.</p>

<p>The scores are then tallied up, and the dictionary passed to the next player. Repeat until everybody has had a turn. This comprises one round.</p>

<p><strong>Scoring</strong> Every player who guesses the right definition gets a point. Every player whose definition got voted on gets the same amount of points as votes. If the dictionary holding player&#8217;s real definition got no votes, he receives a point.</p>

<p><strong>Our gameplay</strong> In Aspen, Colorado, during our week there, we played a 10-person game of dictionary with another family, the Wedners. Here are some of my favorite words and definitions:</p>

<p>Whydah (pronounced &#8220;widdah&#8221;): Fake (Marcus) - The wife of a dead man Real - An African weaverbird</p>

<p>Jaborandi: Fake (Me) - Delicately woven cotten headgarments traditionally worn by the virgin women of Sri Lanka and southern India; a common term for odd hats of all sorts Real - A drug made from the dried leaves of certain South American plants of the rue family</p>

<p>Quassia: Fake (Dad) - Verb; Mongolian horseman&#8217;s mallet swing Real - A South American shrub or small tree related to ailanthus</p>

<p>Waesucks: Fake (Marcus) - The light suction administered by infant clams Real - Scottish interjection used to express pity</p>

<p>Fafnir: Fake (Dora) - An Al Qaeda term for &#8220;homeslice&#8221; Real - The Norse dragon that guarded a treasure and was slain by Sigurd</p>

<p>Hab: Fake (Me) - Noun; scruffy seafaring man; common usage as in Moby Dick with an article: &#8220;Ahab&#8221; Real - Abbreviation; Habacus; Habakkuk</p>

<p>O&#8217;odham: Fake (Me) - Surname of Irish origin; derived from an alternative spelling of the Gaelic word for &#8220;lamb&#8221; Real - the Uto-Aztecan language spoken by the Pimas and Tohono O&#8217;odhams</p>

<p>Banns: Fake (Me) - see: bans Real - A notice announcing a marriage</p>

<p>Jerkwater: Fake (Me) - An uncommon arrangement of two hydrogen molecules and one oxygen molecule such that the trio is unhappy and irritable Fake (Dora) - The full contents of a bathtub having been vacated by a teenage boy who can&#8217;t get any Real - Of or associated with small, remote, and insignificant rural settlements</p>

<p>Happy gameplay!</p>
